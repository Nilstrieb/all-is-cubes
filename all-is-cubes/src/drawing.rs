//! Draw 2D graphics and text into [`Space`]s, using a general adapter for
//! [`embedded_graphics`]'s drawing algorithms.
//!
//! The [`VoxelBrush`] type can also be useful in direct 3D drawing.
//!
//! ## Coordinate system differences
//!
//! [`embedded_graphics`] uses coordinates which are different from ours in
//! two ways that should be kept in mind when trying to align 2D and 3D shapes:
//!
//! *   Text drawing presumes that +X is rightward and +Y is downward. Hence,
//!     text will be upside-down unless the chosen transformation inverts Y (or
//!     otherwise transforms to suit the orientation the text is being viewed from).
//! *   Coordinates are considered to refer to pixel centers rather than low corners,
//!     and rectangles have inclusive upper bounds (whereas our [`GridAab`]s have
//!     exclusive upper bounds).
