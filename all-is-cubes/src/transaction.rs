/// preconditions for it to happen at all.
///
/// Transactions are used:
///
/// * to enable game objects to have effects on their containers in a way compatible
///   with Rust's ownership rules,
/// * to avoid “item duplication” type bugs by checking all preconditions before making
///   any changes, and
/// * to avoid update-order-dependent game mechanics by applying effects in batches.
///
/// A [`Transaction`] is not consumed by committing it; it may be used repeatedly. Future
/// work may include building on this to provide undo/redo functionality.

/// If a transaction implements [`Default`], then the default value should be a
